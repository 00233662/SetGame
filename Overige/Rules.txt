Rules

In the Set card game, the deck consists of cards with 4 
features: shape, color, number, and shading. 
The objective is to find "sets" of 3 cards from the 9 or 12 
cards on the table. A set consists of three cards that, 
for each feature, are either all the same or all different.


Here's how to play the game:

1. Choose a game mode: 27 or 81 cards

2. Player search for sets among the face-up cards.

3. When a player identifies a set, they click on the cards

4. When you found a set, you earn points

5. If you can't find anymore sets you can click the +3 button for 3 more cards.

6. The game ends when there are no cards in the deck or no sets on the table.
